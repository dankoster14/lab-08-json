# Lab 08: Javascript JSON API example

Get an API key from [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) first and replace the bit that says "YOUR-API-KEY-HERE" on line 15 in the HTML. Be careful not to replace the leading "=" or the trailing "&".

Find coordinates for locations on [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/).

Make sure you give the div that will be holding the map a height and width - otherwise it will now show on the page!
